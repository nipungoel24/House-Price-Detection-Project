# Dragon Real Estate Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features like location, area, and amenities. It leverages regression techniques to analyze historical data and provide accurate price estimates.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Uses regression models for price prediction
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implements Scikit-Learn for model training and evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding experience
